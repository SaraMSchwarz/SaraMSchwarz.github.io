I guess you can say I've had an interest in coding ever since I got my first computer with an internet connection. I started with learning HTML, just to see what it was like to set up a very simple website with GeoCities (I don't think they are around anymore!). I enjoyed seeing how using code would change the font size and enable the insertion of pictures. This was quite some time ago and once I went to college, I forgot all about it. 

In grad school I worked as a Graduate Research Assistant and my boss/professor wanted me to learn ActionScript 3 to be used in Flash while developing maps for visually impaired persons. I was handed a laptop, pointed to a cubicle and told to "just learn it". And I did! At least some of it, to the point where I could incorporate sounds etc. in my maps. It was a fun experience, but after graduation I no longer had a use for any programming languages.

I ended up in a career that was technical, but all software development was outsourced to a different company than the one I worked for. However, I would occasionally log in to Codeacademy and start lessons in Python, JavaScript and SQL, hoping I would be able to use some of them in my job, missing that ability to create something. Once I started feeling like I could use a career change, or at least a career refinement, I started to think about my options. Again and again, my mind would return to coding. After thinking about it for months, I decided to invest the time to learn more and started looking at different options from coding bootcamps to getting another degree.

Flatiron School stood out for several reasons. First of all, the reviews were great. People seemed to really enjoy the curriculum and the school has a high job placement rate. Once I started the bootcamp prep course, I found myself liking the way it was set up and felt like I was learning a lot. So, here I am. It's been a few weeks of mostly part-time coding and I'm really enjoying it so far. Stay tuned for posts that are more technical!
